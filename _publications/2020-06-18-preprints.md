Flexibility of polymers defined by an equation in 2019 is related here to thermal conductivity, using reliable data for both properties found in the literature. The resulting equation is simple, it has the form of a quadratic polynomial. The goodness of the fit represented by R2 = 0.975, while R2 = 1 represents a perfect fit. Thus, knowledge of one of these properties can be used for calculation of the other one. The present results are a part of a larger program enabling obtaining by calculation pertinent properties of polymers from other properties for which data are available.
