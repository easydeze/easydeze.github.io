Polymeric materials and components need, first of all, to ‘survive attacks’ by external mechanical forces. One can apply a force slowly along the main axis of the specimen—such as in tensile testing. One can apply a force rapidly perpendicularly to the surface—such as in Vickers hardness determination. We provide for polymers an equation relating their tensile elongation at break to the Vickers hardness.
