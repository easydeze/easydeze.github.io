My name is Danny Zhang, and I am a rising junior at Rice University studying Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Global Health Technologies. 

I've always been interested in the impact that computer science can have on medical and healthcare applications, and I have pursued bioinformatics research and software development opportunities over the past couple of years to that end. I am currently researching at MD Anderson Cancer Center under the guidance of [Dr. Cassian Yee](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/cassian_yee.html), studying the impact that T-Cells can have on acute myeloid leukemia cells. 

This summer, I will be venturing out to see what the world of software engineering holds!

Research Interests
======
At Northwestern University, under the guidance of [Dr. Richard Green](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=11635), I utilized R to analyze liver datasets from the NCBI, finding significant differential gene expression in a variety of hepatic datasets. I co-authored and visualized significant differential pathway analyses in 2 papers in PLOS ONE and Journal of Lipid Research.

At MD Anderson Cancer Center, I performed flow cytometry and developed cell culturing techniques as I elucidated the effect of BH3-mimetics on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and on CD8+ T-Cells.

Now, I hope to delve into AI/ML, specifically in the realm of medical imaging at Rice University.
